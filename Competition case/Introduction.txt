Introduction to the Test Set for Dynamic Hybrid Flow Shop Scheduling Problem
This test set aims to evaluate the performance and efficiency of algorithms for the dynamic hybrid flow shop scheduling problem. The problem involves multiple products being processed on multiple machines across different production stages, with known processing times for each product on each machine. Additionally, the test set considers job arrival times and due dates, adding complexity and practical value to the problem.

Structure of the Test Set:
First Line Data:
Contains three key numbers: the number of product types n, the number of production stages q, and the total number of machines m. In this case, n=6 (six product types), q=2 (two production stages), and m=6 (six machines in total, with three in the first stage and three in the second).
Machine Division:
The second line divides the machines according to production stages. In this case, the first stage has three machines, and the second stage also has three machines. This division helps understand which machines belong to which production stage.
Processing Time Matrix:
Starting from the third line, there is an n*m matrix where each row represents a product and each column represents a machine. The numbers in the matrix indicate the processing time for each product on the corresponding machine. In this case, the matrix contains processing times for six products on six machines.
Job Information:
The fourth-to-last line provides job IDs, which are unique identifiers for each job.
The third-to-last line lists the product IDs for each job, indicating which product type each job corresponds to.
The second-to-last line shows the arrival times for each job, indicating the earliest time point when the job can be scheduled.
The last line gives the due dates for each job, indicating the latest time point when the job must be completed.

****Please note that this is a dynamic flow shop scheduling problem, where jobs can only be scheduled after their arrival times and cannot be pre-input into the scheduling algorithm.
