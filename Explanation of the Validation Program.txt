Main.py as the Main Entry Point for the Validation Program

1.Specify the path for loading the case:
	case_path = os.path.join('Competition case', 'num30_scenario_0.txt')

2.Specify the path for loading the encoding file:
	file_path = os.path.join('ending_log.txt').

3.Call the scheduling module to generate a scheduling model:
	Parse the encoding file.
	Output the completion time and order fulfillment rate for each job arrival.

4.The validation program will check if the encoding file meets the requirements:
	Verify whether the processing sequence of operations satisfies the requirements.
	Check if jobs are assigned to the specified parallel machines.
	Ensure that no operations already started are rescheduled.
	For scheduling plans that violate constraints, the validation program will output the specific error lines and problem descriptions.
